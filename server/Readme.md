Here I have created the followings
1. userController.js file--> it will handle the functionalities that we are going to perform
2. userRoute.js--> we will use all the declared functionalities like register,login etc in this file
3. We will use the userRoute.js file in the index.js file
4. userModel.js ---> This will help us by giving a structure of our input credentials


We must have installed the following library:
# npm i express mongoose nodemon socket.io bcrypt cors dotenv
